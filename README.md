👋 Hi, I'm Fernando!

❓ About Me

Also known as Tyralk (or Eirems in certain online communities). After several years as a 3D artist, I transitioned into the world of Software Development, driven by my passion for learning and creating tools. My primary focus is Java development, and I'm currently diving into Android Studio to start building my own apps soon too!

🛠️ Skills & Interests

I am proficient in Java, with experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm currently working on improving my confidence with Python as well, so that's another one!

One of the things that got me here was my interest in developing custom tools and practical applications, but I’m always open to exploring new technologies and challenges.

To be fair, any excuse to learn something new is welcome! I’m constantly seeking resources and ideas to refine my skills and expand my knowledge, so feel free to reach out and share anything you think might be useful. It will always be greatly appreciated! 😄

🎯 My Goals

As someone who recently joined the world of Software Development, I'm eager to grow and improve in any way possible. My goal is to contribute to exciting projects, collaborate with inspiring people, and keep pushing my boundaries.
